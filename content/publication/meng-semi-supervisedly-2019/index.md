abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) have achieved remarkable advances. Semi-supervised
  variational auto-encoders (SVAE) as a classical DGM offers a principled framework
  to effective generalize from small labelled data to large unlabelled ones, but it
  is difficult to incorporate rich unstructured relationships within the multiple
  heterogeneous entities. In this paper, to deal with the problem, we present a semi-supervised
  co-embedding model for attributed networks (SCAN) based on the generalized SVAE
  for the heterogeneous data, which collaboratively learns low- dimensional vector
  representations of both nodes and attributes for partially labelled attributed networks
  semi-supervisedly. The node and attribute embeddings obtained in a unified manner
  by our SCAN can benefit not only for capturing the proximities between nodes but
  also the affinities between nodes and attributes. Moreover, our model also trains
  a discriminative network to learn the label predictive distribution of nodes. Experimental
  results on real-world networks demonstrate that our model yields excellent performance
  in a number of applications such as attribute inference, user profiling and node
  classification compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

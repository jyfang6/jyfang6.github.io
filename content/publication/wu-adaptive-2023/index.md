abstract: 'This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are
  heterogeneous and sequentially available. Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge
  to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency
  caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among
  mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2)
  they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant
  components. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning
  (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with
  a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous
  tasks. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the number of mixture components, we propose
  a component sparsification method based on evidential theory to filter out redundant
  components. Experimental results show ACML outperforms strong baselines, showing
  the effectiveness of our compositional meta-knowledge, and confirming that ACML
  can adaptively learn meta-knowledge.'

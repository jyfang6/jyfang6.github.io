abstract: 'Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is an increasingly popular technique that
  aims to represent entities and relations of knowledge graphs into low-dimensional
  semantic spaces for a wide spectrum of applications such as link prediction, knowledge
  reasoning and knowledge completion. In this paper, we provide a systematic review
  of existing KGE techniques based on representation spaces. Particularly, we build
  a fine-grained classification to categorise the models based on three mathematical
  perspectives of the representation spaces: (1) Algebraic perspective, (2) Geometric
  perspective, and (3) Analytical perspective. We introduce the rigorous definitions
  of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical
  properties. We further discuss different KGE methods over the three categories,
  as well as summarise how spatial advantages work over different embedding needs.
  By collating the experimental results from downstream tasks, we also explore the
  advantages of mathematical space in different scenarios and the reasons behind them.
  We further state some promising research directions from a representation space
  perspective, with which we hope to inspire researchers to design their KGE models
  as well as their related applications with more consideration of their mathematical
  space properties.'

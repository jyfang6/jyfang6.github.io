abstract: This paper focuses on the task of cross domain few-shot named entity recognition
  (NER), which aims to adapt the knowledge learned from source domain to recognize
  named entities in target domain with only a few labeled examples. To address this
  challenging task, we propose MANNER, a variational memory-augmented few-shot NER
  model. Specifically, MANNER uses a memory module to store information from the source
  domain and then retrieve relevant information from the memory to augment few-shot
  task in the target domain. In order to effectively utilize the information from
  memory, MANNER uses optimal transport to retrieve and process information from memory,
  which can explicitly adapt the retrieved information from source domain to target
  domain and improve the performance in the cross domain few-shot setting. We conduct
  experiments on English and Chinese cross domain few-shot NER datasets, and the experimental
  results demonstrate that MANNER can achieve superior performance.
